# DiscordBot

TLDR: Discord bot written in python that utilizes discord api for some quirky and niche commands. If you want to implement it in your own server, provide the bot your own API key and change the directory of the mp3 files you wish to provide for playing sound effects

This bot can to perform some niche commands focused for a personal server.
Currently the bot can move users from a general voice channel to another (In this use case the bot moves users from "general" to "jackbox"). The bot is also able to join a voice channel and play imbedded mp3 files (See print_sounds function)
